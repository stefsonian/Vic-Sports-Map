A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/courcelan/pen/xbmqXN.

 For one of our latest project with a local information security firm, we went with a tech theme. These buttons are inspired by the computer interface seen in Star Trek with a bit of added transition effects on hover.

The left and right values define the numerator and denominator of the border radius for the transition effects.
